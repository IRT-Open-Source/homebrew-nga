# homebrew-nga

This is a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap for [IRT](https://www.irt.de)'s Next Generation Audio software.

It contains the following formulas:

- [`libadm`](https://github.com/irt-open-source/libadm) - Audio Definition Model (ITU-R BS.2076) library
- [`libbw64`](https://github.com/irt-open-source/libbw64) - Broadcast Wave 64 (ITU-R BS.2088) library

## Usage

The tap can be added to your local homebrew installation using

```
brew tap irt-open-source/homebrew-nga
```

After that the formulas can be used like any other formula in the homebrew core
repository, for example:

```
brew install libadm
```

As always, you may consult the official [homebrew instructions on using taps](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for more information.
